## Authentication System and Bubba Gump Data Analytics Artifact Introduction
First, the showcase of my project Authentication System in IT145 Foundation in Application Development: The user will be prompted to enter their username and password on the zoo’s internal login page, and the credentials will be checked against an employee user record file or database. Once the user has entered their login information, they will click the submit button that will process the information to run the background check. If the user’s information entered matches the zoo records, then the employee will be granted access to the portal with the account access rights granted by their pre-defined role by the zoo keeper/admin.  
- CREATE array based on credentials.txt
 	- Additional values may be added directly to code
- DISPLAY usage information for user
	- PROMPT for username
- IF user enters quit, exit program
	- PROMPT for password
	- IF user enters quit, exit program
- LOOP for no more than 3 user authentication attempts
	* LOOP to determine corresponding array values for username and hashed password
	* IF username matches declared username
		- CONVERT user entered password to hashed password
		- IF hashed user entered password not found
			* PROMPT for credential re-entry
		- IF max attempts reached
			* Alert user to invalid credentials
			* EXIT program
		- ELSE hashed user entered password is found
			* SET user in method of new class
			* DETERMINE user role in method of new class
				- Based on information from credentials.txt
	* CALL welcome method to display corresponding welcome file for role
	* EXIT program
  
	I tried to learn how to enhance my program in NetBeans IDE. In terms of Software Design and Engineering, Authorization system is one of the most important security systems while logging in any applications. We do not want anyone have access to our username or password information. It uses the hashed system MD5. Adding more methods as object oriented is very important. Other skills are learning how to good review a program, find possible faults, coding standards, white spaces, indentations, curly braces, best practices, readable codes, checking each scope, commenting, check methods, testing access to the library, and duplication. Also, it is important to not to copy and paste because it removes most of indentation. In second Enhancement, I make more clean code with more OOP according by adding on userRole class and getUserRole method. I used JOptionPane for the interface. Also, I added try and catch for security and throws exception for that. In terms of algorithms and data structures, I used string object that can store the data as object for username and hash password. I had issue in the choosing what kind of data structures is good for that. Also, I have issue with importing the correct library and using a good method. Finding the correct custom path was a little bit challenging. In JOptionPane interface, sending the correct comment was challenging too.

## Bubba Gump Data Analytics
Second, DAT220 Fundamentals of Data mining with JMP for the data.  I do incorporate data mining. We need to check the data, there are no missing data, not misspelled, no outliers, no outdated data, the information should be based on the fact, no bias and violation against the regulations, avoid incorrect values. I need to focus on the actual data not predicted data and on R-squared monitoring. I need to get the model of data predicting what will happen based on analyzing the data.
	I described more information about the process of gaining the result, not just the result. Working on datamining software like JMP helps programmers to make a better decision and make scripts according to that data. It is vastly used in Artificial intelligence and Machine learning. This is the way that machine can learn how to decide to find a potential customer such as Bubba Gump analyzing data. The result is like the human brain which knows who the target customer is for advertising. It can save lots of time and budget for marketing companies to find good customers faster with lower cost. I add more results for data analyzing for future enhancements. In Bubba Gump data I added more functions that analyze the data better. I need to get the model of data predicting what will happen based on analyzing the data. I used Regression tool, Multivariate Dependence Techniques, Categorical Data.
